                    <p> When it was meant to be, it found a way to bring us together. Being so close yet so far, from
                        class 11 till the days of college, we never really spoke much.
                        But when the time was right, it wasn't just a simple follow request; it was the moment the
                        universe decided to align all the stars
                        for us. From our very first conversation to the countless hours of laughter we've shared, every
                        second has been a chapter in a story I never want to end.</p>
                    <p>You've seen me at my best and supported me at my worst. You're the one I want to share all my
                        secrets, dreams, and adventures with.</p>
